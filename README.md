# Keyword Classification on Google Speech Commands Dataset

This project explores and processes the [Google Speech Commands Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209) to build and train a model for recognizing speech commands. The notebook provides step-by-step data preprocessing, feature extraction, model definition, and training.

## Project Structure

- **`GSpeechComd_Dataset_with_Comments.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook file that includes code, detailed comments, and explanations for processing the dataset and training a model. Different CNN architectures are trained and evaluated.
-[Google Speech Commands Dataset](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/launching-speech-commands-dataset.html): The Google Speech Commands dataset, which contains short audio clips of spoken words, used as the primary data source.

## Features

- **Preprocessing**: Loading and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Applying signal processing techniques to extract features from the audio data.
- **Model Training**: Using a machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train a speech recognition model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy calculations for the models performance.
